# Dinner-Idea-Generator #
--------------------------
## Description ##
-----------------
This project uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to generate random dinner ideas. I built this project  because my girlfriend and I always struggle to come up with creative new ideas for dinner. This project eliminates the problem of coming up with new ideas for dinner that we both enjoy. Don't like the random dinner that we're eating? Don't blame me, blame the *Dinner Idea Generator!*
## Features ##
--------------
The **Dinner Idea Generator** uses JavaScript functions and arrays to output seven random pieces of data. These data pieces include proteins, vegetables, carbs or starches, and cooking techniques. These random data pieces are then returned as a string on the Dinner Idea Generator website. A random example of a dinner output could be "How about deep fried beef with sauteed mushrooms, baked cauliflower and potatoes?" or "How about fried tofu with grilled kale, roasted parsnips and barley?". 
## How to Use ##
----------------
The **Dinner Idea Generator** is extremely easy to use. Simply navigate to the webpage and click the button "Give Me Ideas" to generate your dinner idea. 
## Technologies ##
-------------------
As mentioned previously, **Dinner Idea Generator** uses *HTML*, *CSS*, and *JavaScript* to operate. HTML was used to add text to the website. CSS added some basic styling to Dinner Idea Generator. And, JavaScript added the functionality of the idea generator. 
## Collaborators ##
-------------------
The Dinner Idea Genrator project was built by myself, Evan Dean, as part of my Codecademy "Building Interactive Websites" course.
